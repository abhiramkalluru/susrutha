# Introduction

(Following text is copied from wikipedia)
Susruta is a surgeon and lecturer in Ayurveda . BC A 6th century saint, he was born in Varanasi. His most famous work is the Sushruta Samhita written in Vedic Sanskrit. Diseases and their remedies are extensively written in this Sushruta Samhita. How many other countries in the world have successfully performed surgery in India before the eyes of Apara Dhanvantari Shushrutu who saved lives.

# Mission statement

Single point Agenda:

Operation Susrutha is a non-profit, no plan to earn money as part of this effort at least for the next 2 years, project to help fight any health related issues in India by taking advantage of “digital adoption” effectively & efficiently, i.e., Every Indian citizen has a right to avail medical care, irrespective of the disease or condition they’re in, reach out & avail health care from anywhere in the world by destroying physical boundaries or reachability through the use of technology.

# Why should we pursue this initiative?

- One of the key/important information to be aware of, in this unprecedented CoVid environment/unknown & slightly scary future, 
  is to “know or have a way to identify where to go to when there is a health problem”.
  
  - It doesn’t matter whether it’s the case of CoVid or general health issues, for example: a person can have fever, weakness & some other symptoms.
    This doesn’t mean it is CoVid so not all the hospitals take in-patients.
    
  - I’ve heard so many disturbing instances, one of the instance that I would like to share with everyone:
    
    A person was taken to 18 different hospitals before finding a 19th hospital that could admit him but
    unfortunately he passed away within 10 minutes of getting admitted into that 19th hospital.
      
- Indian government lacks the technical talent/support, someone who can plan, execute & achieve the goals irrespective of the conditions & environment.
